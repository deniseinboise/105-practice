                    <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                    <p>When you start learning to code, you are doing something that you have never done before.<br> It's a new challenge, a new opportunity.</p>
     
                    <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
    
                    <p>When you get stumped, try two things:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Google a solution</li>
                        <li>Take a mental break then start again</li>
                    </ul>
